# 1. Cookies:

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

We have to go into the website they gave, then we need to go to inspect and then cookies. Over there i observed when we typed snickerdoodle (it was given as example there) and entered, the value of cookie changed. I then googled and found that for a cookie, we can either change the name or value. Since the value was changing, I kept on changing values and refreshing the page, which told some random cookie names. At value 18, the flag showed up.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```

## Concepts learnt:

I learned that in the inspect page, we can either change the name or value of cookie. 

## Notes:

I first tried changing the name to admin like i did in citadelCTF, but that was wrong as all of them had the same name, the values were changing so we have to change values.
